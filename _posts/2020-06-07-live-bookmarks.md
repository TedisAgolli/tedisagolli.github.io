Live-bookmarks is a simple extension manager with the added goal of forcing you to prioritize. The difference to a normal bookmark manager is that you can only have up to 5 saved bookmarks at any time. This helps you stop hoarding links that you will never read.

I was prompted to build this when I noticed that a few of my bookmarks folders had so many items that they were basically useless. One example was my Movies folder. I ended up saving so many movies to watch that opening the folder was the equivalent of going to IMDB looking around the top lists. 

Live-bookmarks understands that collecting cool and interesting resources is no longer the problem, prioritizing them is. Live means that the items in this folder are meant to be in constant motion; they are added, read or watched, and then removed.
